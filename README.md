# Supermarket-Database
A project to develop my SQL skills and get information from a database to display in a program.

## Problem Statement
Our database will keep track of all the essential information a supermarket needs to run. It will contain 
employee information, inventory information, supplier information, and customer information, which is 
used in the form of a loyalty program. We need a database because of the potential large amount of 
information that needs to be stored such as all the items sold at the supermarket or all of the customer
accounts. An excel file would get out of hand fast if we tried to use one to store all this data.

## Requirements 
Our database would be administered by store managers. They would use this database to keep track of 
inventory levels and determine when it is time to order more supplies. Since the database will also 
contain supplier information, the managers will know who to order each type of item from. For 
example, “supplier A” may supply meat while “supplier B” supplies vegetables. Managers can also use 
the database to keep track of the current employees and the different departments and positions they 
hold. If someone is fired or moves to a different department then the use of this database will make the 
adjustments easy. The database will also be indirectly used by customers. When customers go to check 
out, they will be asked for loyalty program information. If a customer account is found in the database,
then they will have the chance to earn discounts on products based on the number of points they have. 
This database will benefit both managers and customers. One requirement will be that a managers 
employee ID will begin with MGR so that the interface knows if you’re trying to access a regular 
employees information or a managers.
